            <h2>Mass Ratio and Stellar metallicity Distributions of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs</h2>

Different colours represent planets detected by different methods. The blue shaded region represents a possible paucity of hot massive giant planets around M dwarfs. Right panel: Host star metallicy distribution of hot (red) and warm (blue) Jupiters around M dwarfs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the highest planet-to-star mass ratio among planetary systems, giant planets around M dwarfs are the extreme cases to test current planet formation theories. Over the last two decades, more than a thousand transiting giant planets have been discovered. However, only ~10 hot Jupiters are confirmed to transit M-type stars even though M dwarfs are the most abundant stellar population in our Milky Way. The scarcity of such systems is supposed to be relevant to the failed growth of a massive core to start runaway accretion before disk dissipation. Nevertheless, radial velocity (RV) and microlensing surveys have found numerous (~30) cold Jupiters around M dwarfs. Gravitational instability is thus speculated to be the alternative formation mechanism. The formation channel of giant planets especially hot Jupiters around M dwarfs, is still under debate.</p>
            <p>In this work, we confirmed a new giant planet (TOI-530b) around an early-type M dwarf discovered by TESS. The planet has a radius of 0.8 Jupiter radius and a mass about 0.4 Jupiter mass with a period of 6.4 days. Based on all known giant planets around M dwarfs detected by transit, RV, microlensing and direct imaging, we study their mass ratio and semi-major axis distributions. We identified a dearth of hot massive giant planets around M dwarfs, which was considered as a sign of planet migration or two different formation mechanisms. We further investigated the host star metallicity distributions of hot and warm Jupiters, where we found that hot Jupiters have stronger preference on stellar metallicity with a median value of 0.3 dex.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Between the Solar Twin Abundance Pattern and Rocky Planet Formation?</h2>

            <p class="caption">The mean abundance difference between 36 CKS solar twins with rocky planets and the Sun as a function of condensation temperature of each element. The blue solid line is the linear fit to the abundance trend. The shaded region represents the 1σ  confidence interval. The black dashed line represents the mean abundance difference measurements of 11 nearby solar twins without known planets from previous work. The results indicate that rocky planet formation is probably not the dominated reason for the solar depletion pattern.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Stellar element abundances are important as they may reflect the history of planet formation. Previous studies reported that our Sun shows a refractory element depletion when compared with nearby solar twins, and it was probably relevant to the formation of rocky or giant planets. </p>
            <p>To diagnose which is the major effect, we constructed a sub-sample of solar twins with rocky planets selected from the California-Kepler Survey and studied their element abundance, where the preliminary result showed no statistically significant element depletion like our Sun. This infers that the Solar depletion feature is perhaps not related to rocky planets. We are building a bright TESS solar twin sample with planet candidates and taking Magellan/MIKE spectra with higher SNR to further study this problem through line-by-line differential analysis.</p>

            <h2>An Inconvenient Entanglement on The Planet Signal and Stellar Rotation</h2>

            <p class="caption">Top panel: PFS RV data along with the best-fit GP+planet model.The shaded yellow region represents the 1σ estimate. Middle panel: RV residuals after subtracting the best-fit model. Bottom panel: The red points are the total RV subtracting the best-fit Keplerian component of the GP + Keplerian fit for PFS-only data. The black line is the predicted GP curve. The best-fit Keplerian orbit is shown as the blue curve.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Due to the proximity and brightness, HD 21749 is a remarkable target for investigating the atmospheric properties of its companion. Therefore, mass measurement is especially important to HD 21749b because of the degeneracy between the planet mass and the mean molecular weight. However, HD 21749b has an inconvenient entanglement of the planetary signal and the stellar activity, which have very similar timescales and exhibit similar RV amplitudes. </p>
            <p>We took the stellar rotation information from the TESS light curve and included it in the Gaussian Process (GP) + RV modeling, where we disentangle the planetary component from the stellar activity signal in the RVs. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirmed that without properly taking stellar activity signals into account, the mass measurement of HD21749b is likely to arrive at a significantly underestimated error bar. Previous successful cases of disentanglement using GP very often dealt with systems where the two signals operate on very different timescales. Our work demonstrated that nightly, high-cadence RV observations could retrieve the planet's RV semi-amplitude without significant bias for such extreme cases.</p>

            <h2>A Thick-Disc Planet Detected by TESS</h2>
            <p>Gan, T., Shporer, A., et al. 2020, <i><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..160G/abstract"> LHS 1815b: The First Thick-disk Planet Detected by TESS</a></i></p>

            <br>
            <p>To date, more than 4000 exoplanets have been detected, but few of them have been claimed to be in the thick disk of the Milky Way. A common way to separate different components of the Milky Way (for example, thin and thick disks) relies on the three-dimensinal (3D) spatial motions of stars. This has become possible with GAIA, a space telescope which gives distance, proper motions for relatively bright stars. Furthermore, the recent launched Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) aims to discover a large sample of planets around bright stars in the solar neighborhood across the whole sky. Combined with GAIA, TESS offers an exciting opportunity to study the difference in the planet formation efficiency between stars in the thin and thick disks, which have different age and metallicity distributions.</p>
            <p>LHS 1815b is the first thick-disc planet detected by TESS. The planet has a radius of 1.1 Earth radius with a period of 3.8 days. We analyzed the orbit of the host star LHS 1815, and found that it most likely belongs to the thick disk, reaching about 1.8 kpc above the Galactic plane, several times the height reached by typical stars from the thin disk.</p>
